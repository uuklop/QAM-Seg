# MedIA notes for QAM-Seg

Status: protocol, training hooks, architectural fixes, and representation-level
SSL upgrades are implemented and verified by unit tests (`tests/`).

## Summary of Fixes & Upgrades for MedIA Submission

1. **Backbone Bug Fixes & 4-Way State-Space Disagreement (`models/MambaLiteUNet.py`)**:
   - Protects `mamba_ssm.Mamba` internal initialization (`dt_proj.bias`, `A_log`, `D`) from being overwritten by `_init_weights`.
   - Implements 4-way directional cross-scanning ($\rightarrow, \leftarrow, \downarrow, \uparrow$) across the 4 branches of `AMF` and `CGA`.
   - Extracts per-pixel directional branch variance (`last_branch_disagreement`) and feeds it into `MQE` (`QualityWeights.mamba`), directly coupling the Mamba state-space representation with pseudo-label quality estimation.
   - Wires `--no-amf`, `--no-lgfm`, and `--no-cga` in `MambaLiteUNet` and `scripts/count_params_flops.py`.

2. **SSL Pipeline Bug Fixes (`qamseg/`)**:
   - **Weak/Strong Coordinate Alignment**: `strong_augment` now shares `weak_augment`'s geometric frame and applies photometric contrast/brightness scaling + cutout + optional noise, fixing the $180^\circ$ flip mismatch.
   - **Full Unlabeled Pool Coverage**: `iter_dual_batches` iterates across `max(len(labeled_loader), len(unlabeled_loader))` batches per epoch with `shuffle=True` and labeled spatial augmentations (`augment_labeled_batch`).
   - **Uncancelled Image-Level Quality Weights**: `quality_gated_consistency_loss` normalizes spatial weights per active image while preserving the continuous image quality weight $q^\gamma$.
   - **Quality-Guided Feature Prototype Alignment (`--ssl-qar prototype`) & CutMix (`--ssl-cutmix`)**: Adds representation-level boundary regularization (`prototype_quality_regularization`) and region mixing (`quality_guided_cutmix`), available via recipes `qam-qar` and `qam-full`.
